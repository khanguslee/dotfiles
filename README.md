# dotfiles

Random config files for various applications. Mainly used to setup a new macbook.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have x-code updated by running `xcode-select --install`!

Run the `install.sh` script to install _mostly_ everything automatically.

Run the following command to make it executable.

``` sh
chmod +x install.sh
```

Run Brewfile
```sh
brew bundle
```
